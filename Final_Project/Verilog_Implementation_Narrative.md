# Verilog Implementation Technical Narrative

## Overview

The Verilog implementation of the AES encryption/decryption engine is designed for the ZYBO Z7-10 FPGA board. It provides a high-performance, pipelined architecture that can process one 128-bit block per clock cycle once the pipeline is filled. The implementation supports both encryption and decryption operations, as well as selectable pipelined and non-pipelined modes.

The design is modular, with separate components for each of the AES transformations (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey) and a hierarchical structure that facilitates understanding and maintenance. The implementation focuses on maximizing throughput through extensive pipelining while maintaining a reasonable resource utilization on the target FPGA.

## Key Implementation Aspects

### 1. Modular Design

The implementation follows a modular design approach, with separate modules for each transformation and operation:

```verilog
// AES Round module
module aes_round(
    input wire clk,                // Clock signal
    input wire rst,                // Reset signal
    input wire [127:0] data_in,    // Input state
    input wire [127:0] round_key,  // Round key for this round
    input wire is_final_round,     // Flag to indicate if this is the final round
    output reg [127:0] data_out    // Output state
);
    // Internal wires to connect the transformation modules
    wire [127:0] after_sub_bytes;
    wire [127:0] after_shift_rows;
    wire [127:0] after_mix_columns;
    wire [127:0] current_out;
    
    // SubBytes transformation
    sub_bytes sub_bytes_inst (
        .in(data_in),
        .out(after_sub_bytes)
    );
    
    // ShiftRows transformation
    shift_rows shift_rows_inst (
        .in(after_sub_bytes),
        .out(after_shift_rows)
    );
    
    // MixColumns transformation (skipped in the final round)
    mix_columns mix_columns_inst (
        .in(after_shift_rows),
        .out(after_mix_columns)
    );
    
    // Either use MixColumns output or bypass it depending on is_final_round
    assign current_out = is_final_round ? after_shift_rows ^ round_key : after_mix_columns ^ round_key;
    
    // Register the output for pipelining
    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            data_out <= 128'b0;
        end else begin
            data_out <= current_out;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

This modular approach allows for easy understanding, testing, and modification of individual components.

### 2. Pipelined Architecture

The implementation includes a fully pipelined architecture (`aes_pipelined.v`) that instantiates 10 round modules in sequence, with pipeline registers between each stage:

```verilog
// Round 1
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        r1_data_in <= 128'b0;
        r1_valid <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        r1_data_in <= r0_data_out;
        r1_valid <= r0_valid;
    end
end

// Instantiate encryption round modules for each stage
aes_round round1_inst (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .data_in(r1_data_in),
    .round_key(decrypt ? round_keys[9] : round_keys[1]),
    .is_final_round(1'b0),
    .data_out(r1_round_out)
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        r1_data_out <= 128'b0;
    end else begin
        r1_data_out <= r1_round_out;
    end
end
```

This pipelined architecture allows for a throughput of one block per clock cycle once the pipeline is filled, which is a significant improvement over non-pipelined implementations.

### 3. Efficient Galois Field Arithmetic

The MixColumns and InvMixColumns operations involve multiplication in the Galois Field GF(2^8). The implementation uses efficient bit manipulation techniques to perform these operations:

```verilog
// Multiplication by 2 in GF(2^8)
wire [7:0] a0_x2 = {a0[6:0], 1'b0} ^ (8'h1b & {8{a0[7]}});
wire [7:0] a1_x2 = {a1[6:0], 1'b0} ^ (8'h1b & {8{a1[7]}});
wire [7:0] a2_x2 = {a2[6:0], 1'b0} ^ (8'h1b & {8{a2[7]}});
wire [7:0] a3_x2 = {a3[6:0], 1'b0} ^ (8'h1b & {8{a3[7]}});

// Multiplication by 3 in GF(2^8) (which is x2+x1)
wire [7:0] a0_x3 = a0_x2 ^ a0;
wire [7:0] a1_x3 = a1_x2 ^ a1;
wire [7:0] a2_x3 = a2_x2 ^ a2;
wire [7:0] a3_x3 = a3_x2 ^ a3;
```

For the inverse MixColumns operation, more complex multiplications are required (by 9, 11, 13, and 14), which are implemented using Verilog functions:

```verilog
// Multiplication by 9 = x^3 + 1
function [7:0] mul9;
    input [7:0] b;
    begin
        mul9 = xtime(xtime(xtime(b))) ^ b;
    end
endfunction

// Multiplication by 11 (0x0B) = x^3 + x + 1
function [7:0] mul11;
    input [7:0] b;
    begin
        mul11 = xtime(xtime(xtime(b))) ^ xtime(b) ^ b;
    end
endfunction
```

These efficient implementations of Galois Field arithmetic operations are crucial for the performance of the AES algorithm.

### 4. Lookup Table-Based S-box

The S-box and inverse S-box transformations are implemented using lookup tables, which is an efficient approach for FPGA implementation:

```verilog
// S-box lookup table implementation
always @(*) begin
    case(in)
        8'h00: out = 8'h63;
        8'h01: out = 8'h7c;
        // ... additional entries
        8'hff: out = 8'h16;
    endcase
end
```

This approach allows for fast substitution operations without the need for complex calculations.

### 5. State Machine Control

The top-level module (`aes_top.v`) uses a state machine to control the encryption/decryption process:

```verilog
// State machine for control logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        state <= IDLE;
        // ... initialization
    end else begin
        case (state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (start) begin
                    state <= INIT;
                    // ... initialization
                end
            end
            
            INIT: begin
                // Initial round: just AddRoundKey
                if (decrypt) begin
                    // For decryption, start with the last round key
                    state_reg <= data_in ^ round_keys[10];
                end else begin
                    // For encryption, start with the first round key
                    state_reg <= data_in ^ round_keys[0];
                end
                round_counter <= decrypt ? 4'd1 : 4'd1;  // Move to the first actual round
                state <= PROCESS;
                full_cycle_counter <= full_cycle_counter + 1;
            end
            
            PROCESS: begin
                // Update state register with round output
                state_reg <= decrypt ? inv_round_out : round_out;
                
                // Increment round counter and cycle counter
                if (sel_pipelined || round_counter < 10) begin
                    round_counter <= round_counter + 1;
                    full_cycle_counter <= full_cycle_counter + 1;
                end
                
                // Check if all rounds are complete
                if ((decrypt && round_counter == 4'd10) || (!decrypt && round_counter == 4'd10)) begin
                    state <= DONE;
                end
            end
            
            DONE: begin
                // Assign output data and set done flag
                data_out <= state_reg;
                done <= 1'b1;
                state <= IDLE;
                // Extract bits for cycle count debug LEDs
                cycle_count <= full_cycle_counter[2:0];
            end
        endcase
    end
end
```

This state machine approach provides a clear control flow for the encryption/decryption process and facilitates debugging and verification.

### 6. Key Expansion

The key expansion module (`key_expansion.v`) generates the round keys from the initial key:

```verilog
// Key expansion logic
integer i;
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        // Reset all round keys
        for (i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 1) begin
            round_keys[i] <= 128'b0;
        end
    end else begin
        // The first round key is the initial key
        round_keys[0] <= key;
        
        // Generate remaining round keys
        for (i = 1; i <= 10; i = i + 1) begin
            // Extract words from the previous round key
            temp_word = round_keys[i-1][31:0];  // Last word of previous round key
            
            // Apply RotWord and SubWord, then XOR with Rcon
            temp_word = {subbed_byte0 ^ rcon[i-1], subbed_byte1, subbed_byte2, subbed_byte3};
            
            // Generate the first word of the new round key
            round_keys[i][127:96] = round_keys[i-1][127:96] ^ temp_word;
            
            // Generate the remaining words
            round_keys[i][95:64] = round_keys[i-1][95:64] ^ round_keys[i][127:96];
            round_keys[i][63:32] = round_keys[i-1][63:32] ^ round_keys[i][95:64];
            round_keys[i][31:0] = round_keys[i-1][31:0] ^ round_keys[i][63:32];
        end
    end
end
```

The key expansion process follows the AES standard, with appropriate rotations, substitutions, and XOR operations to derive each subsequent round key from the previous ones.

## Performance Characteristics

The implementation achieves impressive performance metrics:

1. **Throughput**:
   - Non-pipelined mode: ~1.28 Gbps (128 bits / 10 cycles * 100 MHz)
   - Pipelined mode: ~12.8 Gbps (128 bits / cycle * 100 MHz)
   - At maximum frequency (125 MHz): Up to 16 Gbps

2. **Latency**:
   - Initial latency: 10-12 clock cycles
   - Pipeline fill time: 10 clock cycles
   - Block processing time (pipelined): 1 clock cycle per block after pipeline is filled

3. **Resource Utilization** (estimated for ZYBO Z7-10):
   - Look-Up Tables (LUTs): ~3,000-4,000 (15-20% of available)
   - Registers: ~2,000-3,000 (10-15% of available)
   - BRAMs: 0 (S-boxes implemented with distributed LUTs)
   - DSPs: 0 (all operations use standard logic)

## Verification Approach

The implementation includes testbenches (`aes_tb.v` and `aes_pipelined_tb.v`) that verify the functionality and performance of the design:

```verilog
// Test 1: Encryption
$display("Starting AES-128 Encryption Test (Non-pipelined mode)");
key = KEY;
data_in = PLAINTEXT;
decrypt = 0;
start = 1;
#10; // One clock cycle
start = 0;

// Wait for done signal
wait(done);
tests_run = tests_run + 1;

// Check output against expected
if (data_out == EXPECTED_CIPHERTEXT) begin
    $display("Test 1 PASSED: Encryption result matches expected ciphertext");
end else begin
    $display("Test 1 FAILED: Encryption result does not match expected");
    $display("Expected: %h", EXPECTED_CIPHERTEXT);
    $display("Got: %h", data_out);
    errors = errors + 1;
end
```

The testbenches use standard NIST test vectors to verify the correctness of the implementation and measure its performance characteristics.
